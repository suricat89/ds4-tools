# Dualshock 4 Tools

This app is intended for people that share their Dualshock 4 controllers among a PS4 console and a PC.

It will listen to all Bluetooth devices in pairing mode and check if one of them is on a list of devices that should be automatically paired.

If your PC is a retro gaming platform (ie. don't have keyboard or mouse attached to it), then you will not have to worry with the bluetooth pairing process because this app will pair your Dualshock 4 controllers as soon as it detects it is in pairing mode!

Though it was built arround a Dualshock 4 controller, but it just uses the `bluetoothctl` CLI to pair the device, so it would be supposed work for any kind of bluetooth device (Bluetooth Headset, Dualshock5, XBox controllers, etc.)
